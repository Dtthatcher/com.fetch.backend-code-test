This is a simple web service, written in Kotlin with the KTOR Framework and Exposed DSL.

The recommend IDE for running this program is IntelliJ Idea. 
<br>Community Edition is just fine.
<br>You can get it <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC">here</a>
<br><br>
Kotlin should come out of the box, but to be sure go to File/Settings/Pluggins and search for Kotlin and Install it
<br>Once installed click File/New/Project From Version Control
