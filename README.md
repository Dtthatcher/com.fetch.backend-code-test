This is a simple web service, written in Kotlin with the KTOR Framework and Exposed DSL.

The recommend IDE for running this program is IntelliJ Idea. 
<br>Community Edition is just fine.
<br>You can get it <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC">here</a>
<br><br>
Kotlin should come out of the box, but to be sure go to File/Settings/Pluggins and search for Kotlin and Install it
<br>Once installed click File/New/Project From Version Control
<br>Copy and past the following url to link to this project https://github.com/Dtthatcher/com.fetch.backend-code-test.git
<br>Once the project loads in the IDE then click the dropdown on the Upper Right Toolbar (in between the build button and play button)
<br>select add configuration
<br>Click on the plus symbol and select Kotlin
<br>Feel free to name the configuration whatever you like.
<br>Open the "Use classpath of module" dropdown and select the one that ends in .main
<br>In the Main class text bar write com.fetch.ApplicationKt and finally click Ok.
<br>
<br>Now you can run the server!
